# voice_activity_detection_challenge
Codes for Voice Activity Detection Challenge which I did at 2018. 

Tried two different models
- CNN architecture with MFCC features which is based on [this paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8278160).
- Pitch estimation which is based on [CREPE library](https://github.com/marl/crepe).
